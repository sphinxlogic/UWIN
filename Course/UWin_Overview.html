      <P>Most of the <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> API is implemented by the POSIX.DLL 
      dynamically loaded (shared) library. Programs linked with POSIX.DLL run 
      under the <STRONG>WIN32</STRONG> subsystem instead of the 
      <STRONG>POSIX</STRONG> subsystem, so programs can freely intermix 
      <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> and <STRONG>WIN32</STRONG> library calls. A <NOBR><A 
      href="http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/man/man1/cc.html"><STRONG>cc</STRONG></A>(1)</NOBR> 
      command is provided to compile and link programs for <STRONG>UWIN</STRONG> 
      on Windows using traditional <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> build tools such as

      actual compilation and linking. It can be used with the Microsoft Visual 
      C/C++ 5.X compiler, the Visual C/C++ 6.X compiler, the Visual C/C++ 7.X 
      compiler, the <A href="http://www.digitalmars.com/" target=_top>Digital

      target=_top>GNU compiler and development tools</A> are also available for 
      download to <STRONG>UWIN.</STRONG> 
      <P><STRONG>UWIN</STRONG> runs best on Windows XP/NT/2000 with NTFS, but 
      will run in degraded mode with the FAT file system, and further 
      degradation with Windows ME/98/95. See the README file for more details. 
      <P><STRONG>UWIN</STRONG> provides the following functionality for 
      <STRONG>WIN32</STRONG> applications: 
      <DL compact>
        <DL compact>
          <DT><STRONG>Process control and management:</STRONG>
          <DD>While processes can be created using the <NOBR><A 
          href="http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/man/man2/fork.html"><STRONG>fork</STRONG></A>(2)</NOBR> 
          function, <STRONG>UWIN</STRONG> includes a <EM>spawn</EM> family of 
          functions that combines the functionality of <EM>fork/exec</EM> for 
          efficiency. With the <EM>exec</EM> family of functions, an existing 
          process can be overlaid with another process. Each process has a 
          unique process id and each process belongs to a process group. The 
          <NOBR><A 
          href="http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/man/man2/vfork.html"><STRONG>vfork</STRONG></A>(2)</NOBR> 
          function is also an efficient way to create processes. 
          <DT><STRONG>File descriptor semantics:</STRONG>
          <DD>Open files, pipes, sockets, fifos, and character and block special 
          devices files have file descriptors associated with them. They can be 
          duped and inherited with <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> semantics. 
          <DT><STRONG>UNIX signal semantics:</STRONG>
          <DD>Nearly all of the <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> signals are provided, 
          including job control signals so that <NOBR><A 
          href="http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/man/man1/ksh.html"><STRONG>ksh</STRONG></A>(1)</NOBR> 
          can stop and restart jobs. A process can catch, block or ignore 
          signals. Signals can be sent to processes or to process groups. 
          Applications compiled with the <TT>-D_BSDCOMPAT</TT> flag obey UCB 
          <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> signal semantics. 
          <DT><STRONG>Support for devices:</STRONG>
          <DD><STRONG>UWIN</STRONG> provides character and block devices with 
          major and minor numbers as found on <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> systems. 
          Support for direct access to floppy drives (<TT>/dev/fd0</TT>), and 
          SCSI tape drives (<TT>/dev/mt0</TT>), as well as ptys and ttys is 
          available. 
          <DT><STRONG>Terminal interface for consoles, sockets, and serial 
          lines:</STRONG>
          <DD>The <STRONG>POSIX</STRONG> termios interface is supported for 
          consoles with vt100 emulation. Serial lines, and sockets that have 
          been designated as virtual terminals. <STRONG>UWIN</STRONG> supports 
          pseudo-ttys. 
          <DT><STRONG>Use of the mouse with console windows:</STRONG>
          <DD>The left mouse button in a console window can be used to select 
          text and copy to the clipboard. The right button (or middle button on 
          a three button mouse) can be used to paste text from the clipboard. 
          The <TT>/dev/clipboard</TT> pseudo-device can be used to redirect 
          command input and output to the clipboard. The <TT>/dev/windows</TT> 
          pseudo-device can be used within <NOBR><A 
          href="http://www.research.att.com/~gsf/man/man2/select.html"><STRONG>select</STRONG></A>(2)</NOBR> 
          to block until mouse or keyboard events are received. 
          <DT><STRONG>UCB sockets based on WINSOCK:</STRONG>
          <DD>The socket interface uses the UCB header files and naming 
          conventions, but is implemented as calls to WINSOCK. Sockets are file 
          descriptors and obey file descriptor semantics. Both internet domain 
          protocol (i.e. AF_INET family) and UNIX domain sockets (AF_UNIX 
          family) are provided. The multicast socket protocol is supported. The 
          connect stream library, which provides a higher level and easier to 
          user interface, is also provided. 
          <DT><STRONG>Pathname mapping from UNIX to Windows:</STRONG>
          <DD>UWIN provides UNIX style naming for all files with <TT>/</TT> as 
          the filename delimiter by creating mounts. The <TT>/</TT> directory 
          location can be selected at installation. Each drive letter in Windows 
          is mounted in a single letter directory name under <TT>/</TT> so that 
          <TT>/a/file</TT> is the UWIN name for <TT>a:</TT>\file. In addition, 
          certain directories are implicitly mounted such as <TT>/sys</TT> on 
          the system directory, <TT>/win</TT> on the windows directory, and 
          <TT>/msdev</TT> on the directory containing the Microsoft development 
          kit if installed. The character and block special devices are in 
          <TT>/dev</TT> and use naming conventions found on most UNIX systems. 
          UWIN also supports UNC (universal naming convention) names for files 
          that begin with <TT>//</TT>. An API function is provided to map the 
          UNIX name into the Windows name. The mapping is available from 
          <TT>ksh</TT> as well. 
          <DT><STRONG>UNIX naming conventions:</STRONG>
          <DD>The <TT>PATH</TT> variable is a <STRONG>:</STRONG> separated list 
          of directories rather than a <STRONG>;</STRONG> separated list. The 
          <TT>cc</TT> command generates files with a <TT>.</TT>o suffix by 
          default. However, some characters such as <STRONG></STRONG>\, 
          <STRONG>*</STRONG>, <STRONG>?</STRONG>, <STRONG>|</STRONG>, 
          <STRONG>&amp;</STRONG>, <STRONG>&lt;</STRONG>. <STRONG>&gt;</STRONG>, 
          and <STRONG>:</STRONG> are not valid as part of file names. By 
          default, directories are mounted without case distinction. However, 
          the <TT>mount</TT> command allows directories to be mounted as case 
          sensitive so that the files <TT>makefile</TT> and <TT>Makefile</TT> 
          are distinct. In addition, there is a registry key that can be set to 
          make the default case sensitive. 
          <DT><STRONG>Mapping to and from UNIX ids/permissions to NT/2000/XP 
          permissions:</STRONG>
          <DD>Windows NT/2000/XP subject identifiers are mapped to UNIX user ids 
          and group ids. UNIX permissions are mapped onto Windows NT/2000/XP 
          file ACLs. The Administrator can use <TT>chown()</TT> to change the 
          owner and or group of a file. 
          <DT><STRONG>File control locking:</STRONG>
          <DD>UNIX file control advisory locking is supported by UWIN with 
          deadlock detection. 
          <DT><STRONG>Memory mapping and shared memory:</STRONG>
          <DD>Both <TT>mmap()</TT> and the system V shared memory facilities are 
          provided. 
          <DT><STRONG>System V IPC:</STRONG>
          <DD>The System V semaphore and message calls are implemented. 
          <DT><STRONG>Runtime linking of dynamically linked libraries:</STRONG>
          <DD>The <TT>dlopen()</TT>, <TT>dlsym()</TT> interface from System V 
          Release 4 is provided. 
          <DT><STRONG>Error mapping from Windows to UNIX:</STRONG>
          <DD>Errors returned by <STRONG>WIN32</STRONG> functions are mapped 
          into <STRONG>UNIX</STRONG> errnos. 
          <DT><EM>i</EM><STRONG>-node numbers:</STRONG>
          <DD>An <EM>i</EM>-node number is returned when reading a file and when 
          stating a file. 
          <DT><STRONG>Hard links:</STRONG>
          <DD>Hard links are supported on both NTFS and FAT file systems. 
          <DT><STRONG>Symbolic links:</STRONG>
          <DD>Symbolic links to files and directories can be created in UWIN and 
          are implemented as Windows shortcuts. A <TT>.lnk</TT> suffix will be 
          appended to these file names but will not appear when reading 
          directories with UWIN. Shortcuts created by Windows appear as symbolic 
          links in UWIN but do not have the <TT>.lnk</TT> suffix removed. 
          <DT><STRONG>Fifo's:</STRONG>
          <DD>Fifo's (UNIX named pipes) can be created with <TT>mkfifo()</TT> 
          and opened as an ordinary file. 
          <DT><STRONG>Setuid and setgid programs:</STRONG>
          <DD>Users can authorize setuid and/or setgid programs to be run on 
          their behalf and use <TT>chmod()</TT> to turn on setuid permission for 
          a program. The program must be on an NTFS file system. 
          <DT><STRONG><TT>inet</TT> <STRONG>Daemons and 
          commands:</STRONG></STRONG>
          <DD>UWIN 3.2 comes with the UCB inet daemon, the telnet daemon, the 
          rlogin daemon, and the rsh daemon. It also includes the 
          <TT>telnet</TT>, <TT>ftp</TT>, <TT>rsh</TT>, and <TT>rlogin</TT> 
          programs. The <TT>ssh</TT> daemon and program can be built from the 
          source but is not included because of possible export restrictions. 
          <DT><STRONG>Access of Registry through the File System:</STRONG>
          <DD>UWIN treats the Windows registry as a file system with registry 
          keys treated as files, and keys that have sub-keys treated as 
          directories. You can use UWIN tools directly on registry keys. The 
          registry is automatically mounted under <TT>/reg</TT> during startup. 
          <DT><STRONG>ssh and ssh daemon:</STRONG>
          <DD>A compilation of openssh-3.6p1. <STRONG>Cron daemon:</STRONG> UWIN 
          comes with a cron daemon that is used for running <TT>at</TT> and 
          <TT>cron</TT> jobs. The cron daemon is started by <TT>/etc/rc</TT> on 
          Windows NT/2000/XP. 
          <DT><STRONG>AT&amp;T open source utilities:</STRONG>
          <DD>Most of the UWIN utilities are based on the <A 
          href="http://www.research.att.com/sw/download/" target=_top>AT&amp;T 
          open source utilities</A> that are portable across virtually all 
          systems and are based on the <STRONG>POSIX</STRONG> and 
          <STRONG>X/Open</STRONG> standards. The utilities generate their own 
          manual pages. 
          <DT><STRONG>Development tools:</STRONG>
          <DD>UWIN comes with <TT>cc</TT> and <TT>ncc</TT> compiler wrappers 
          that use the Visual C/C++ compiler to build UWIN or native 
          applications respectively. Development tools such as <TT>yacc</TT>, 
          <TT>lex</TT>, <TT>ar</TT>, <TT>nm</TT> and <TT>rcs</TT> are also 
          provided. UWIN provides both the traditional <TT>make</TT> and the 
          much more powerful <A href="http://www.bell-labs.com/project/nmake/" 
          target=_top>AT&amp;T nmake</A> building tool. 
          <DT><STRONG>Support for multibyte locales:</STRONG>
          <DD>Most of the utilities and libraries support localization to 
          different locales including multibyte locales. The <TT>iconv</TT> 
          utility can be used to convert from one character set to another. 
          <STRONG>X11 server and utilities:</STRONG> A compilation of X11R6.5 is 
          available as add on packages. </DD></DL></DL>
      <P>The <A href="http://kornshell.com/" target=_top>KornShell,</A> 
      (<TT>ksh</TT>) can be started by double clicking the icon labeled "ksh for 
      Windows NT" in the UWIN 3.2 program group. In addition The KornShell runs 
      in a console window, just like the MS-DOS command shell. Once <TT>ksh</TT> 
      is running, all of the UNIX utilities can be executed. In addition, 
      <TT>ksh</TT> can execute native Windows applications. The UWIN console 
      provides an emulation of the VT100 terminal so that programs that use the 
      curses library should work. All the environment variables of Windows that 
      have been initialized when <TT>ksh</TT> has been started can be accessed 
      from <TT>ksh</TT>. Some variables, such as <TT>PATH</TT>, which are 
      understood by both Windows and UNIX utilities, but which use different 
      formats, are converted to UNIX formats when executing UNIX utilities, and 
      converted back when executing Windows utilities. The environment variable 
      <TT>DOSPATHVARS</TT> can be set to the names of additional variables that 
      get converted to and from native path formats. 
      <P>Online documentation is obtained by clicking on the UWIN quick 
      reference icon. Most commands generate their own documentation when you 
      invoke the command as <TT>command --man</TT>. In addition <TT>man -b</TT> 
      <EM>command</EM> will display command documentation in a browser window.
